# CHANGELOG.md

This file is the concise living history of meaningful project changes.

It records what was added, changed, removed, fixed, or deprecated at a project level. It is not a full git log, not a roadmap, and not a replacement for specs, tests, or ExecPlans.

## How To Use

- Add entries only for meaningful project changes: behavior, formulas, data flow, configs, commands, outputs, docs structure, source-of-truth rules, or user-facing workflows.
- Keep each bullet short: one change, one sentence, no implementation essay.
- Do not log every typo, formatting edit, generated-output refresh, or internal refactor with no project-facing effect.
- Link the owning document or module when it helps.
- When an item from [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) is fixed, remove it from active issues and add one short `Fixed` entry here if the fix is meaningful.
- For large changes, use this file as the summary and keep detailed rationale in an ExecPlan under `docs/exec_plans/`.

## Entry Format

Use date-based sections unless formal releases are introduced later.

```markdown
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Category: Added

- Short change summary.

Category: Changed

Category: Removed

## 2026-05-17

### Added

- Added [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) as the durable phased development roadmap and audit-to-session backlog.
- Added active audit-derived issues to [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for unresolved source-of-truth, config UI, rebalance, encoding, and docs-verification gaps.
- Added [scripts/verify_docs.py](scripts/verify_docs.py), [src/docs_verify.py](src/docs_verify.py), and [tests/test_docs_links.py](tests/test_docs_links.py) for repeatable Markdown link and stale-reference checks.

### Changed

- Updated [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) to remove the stale empty-log wording and record the roadmap ownership decision.

### Fixed

- Project-wide documentation hygiene: fixed punctuation/math mojibake in `.cursor/` agents and rules, `docs/`, and engineering Python (`run_report.py`, `src/snapshot.py`, `results_dashboard/app.py`, `src/pdf_reports.py`, `src/config.py`); restored cp1251-mojibake logger text in `run_report.py`.
- Cleaned source-document mojibake in [production_workflow.md](docs/specs/production_workflow.md), [stress_testing_spec.md](docs/specs/stress_testing_spec.md), [metrics_specification.md](docs/specs/metrics_specification.md), and [view_after_optimization_spec.md](docs/specs/view_after_optimization_spec.md).
- Clarified [rebalance.py](src/rebalance.py) threshold docstrings: `threshold_pct` gates on max absolute per-ticker weight drift only; added focused regression tests.
- Rewrote the [stress testing spec](docs/specs/stress_testing_spec.md) stress covariance section so `taxonomy_blend_v1` is the current default and `uniform_legacy` is clearly legacy-only.
- Removed the stale editable `rc_asset_cap_pct` field from the config UI and added focused regression coverage.
- Updated the config UI to separate `analysis_mode`, user-entered `current_weights`, and read-only generated `portfolio_weights.yml` output.

## 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added Portfolio X-Ray v2 with generated `portfolio_xray.json`, common section schema, rule-based hidden-risk flags, archetype caveats, weakness map, and diagnostic-only report wiring.
- Added `analysis_setup_v1` as the resolved Input and Assumptions runtime contract and exported it in run artifacts alongside projected `input_assumptions`.
- Added Portfolio X-Ray summary helpers for report/commentary surfaces, including setup, allocation, risk-contribution, and explanatory diagnostic verdict sections.
- Added Input and Assumptions Layer V1 with `analysis_mode`, `current_weights`, an `input_assumptions` artifact summary, and the canonical [input assumptions spec](docs/specs/input_assumptions_spec.md).
- Added [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) as a living glossary for shared project terminology.
- Added [OUTPUTS.md](OUTPUTS.md) as the root map for generated outputs, report artifacts, output folders, formats, and generated-vs-source boundaries.
- Added [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) as the explicit task workflow from request to implementation, verification, docs sync, project memory, and commit.
- Added [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) as the concise living decision log for key project decisions and rationale.
- Added [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) as the concise living history for meaningful project changes.
- Added [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) as the living register for active issues, model limitations, testing gaps, and technical debt.

### Changed

- Populated [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) with the initial 80 shared project terms.
- Linked decision-log, changelog, and known-issues governance from the top-level documentation maps.
- Simplified top-level documentation routing and clarified source-of-truth links across root docs.

## 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added [DATA.md](DATA.md) as the living data-layer map.
- Added [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) as the project verification framework.

### Changed

- Reorganized project documentation around compact top-level maps and detailed specs under [docs/specs/](docs/specs/README.md).
- Clarified that [docs/DIAGNOSTIC_PRODUCT_CONCEPT.md](docs/DIAGNOSTIC_PRODUCT_CONCEPT.md) is a living product blueprint, not a binding implementation spec.
