# CHANGELOG.md

This file is the concise living history of meaningful project changes.

It records what was added, changed, removed, fixed, or deprecated at a project level. It is not a full git log, not a roadmap, and not a replacement for specs, tests, or ExecPlans.

## How To Use

- Add entries only for meaningful project changes: behavior, formulas, data flow, configs, commands, outputs, docs structure, source-of-truth rules, or user-facing workflows.
- Keep each bullet short: one change, one sentence, no implementation essay.
- Do not log every typo, formatting edit, generated-output refresh, or internal refactor with no project-facing effect.
- Link the owning document or module when it helps.
- When an item from [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) is fixed, remove it from active issues and add one short `Fixed` entry here if the fix is meaningful.
- For large changes, use this file as the summary and keep detailed rationale in an ExecPlan under `docs/exec_plans/`.

## Entry Format
